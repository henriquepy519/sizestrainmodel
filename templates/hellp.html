        <p>Welcome to the MSS help page! Here, you will find comprehensive guidance to make the most of our software's advanced functionality. To determine the microstructural parameters (average crystallite size and microstrain) in materials using X-ray diffraction, it is necessary to obtain the values of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and the angular positions for each peak in the sample's diffraction pattern. In the Uniform Deformation Stress Model (UDSM) and the Uniform Deformation Energy Density Model (UDEDM), in addition to the previously mentioned parameters, the Miller indices related to each reflection and the material's specific elastic constants are required. Subsequently, the software performs a linear fit with the ordered pairs to be defined according to the chosen model to obtain the slope coefficient, which is related to the microstrain; and also the intercept coefficient, which refers to the average dimensions of the crystallites. In the sections below, the user will find the basic theoretical foundation for all models, tutorials, examples, and references. </p>

                        The Williamson-Hall model is a technique for analyzing X-ray diffraction data in polycrystalline materials. It is used to separate strain (microstrain) contributions on crystal lattice and particle size. The model relies on the Scherrer (SCHERRER, 1918) and Stokes-Wilson (STOKES, 1943) equations. The Stokes-Wilson equation assumes that the microstrain \( \epsilon \) is directly proportional to term \( \beta_{\epsilon} \) and inversely proportional to the tangent of the Bragg angle. The crystal size and microstrain with the broadening of diffraction peaks are defined in equations (\ref{eq:1}) and (\ref{eq:2}) respectively,

                        and

                    <p>where \( \langle D \rangle \) is the average crystal size; \( \langle \epsilon \rangle \) is the average microstrain; \( \lambda \) is the incident radiation wavelength; \( \theta_{hkl} \) is the diffraction angle; \( \beta_D \) is the size contribution to the full width at half of the maximum diffraction peak; and \( \beta_\epsilon \) represents the microstrain contribution to the diffraction profile, for which the Miller indices ( \( hkl \) ) correspond to the planes of the diffraction peaks present in the powder diffraction patterns. Parameter \( K \) depends on the particle shape and the reflection type, typically assumed to be spherical and with a value of \( 0.9 \) for spherical crystals.</p>


                    <p>Williamson-Hall (WILLIAMSON, 1953) proposed equation (\ref{eq:3}), which shows that the peak shape can be described by a Lorentzian distribution. Thus, it implies that the overall width can be obtained by using the convolution theory. It states that the convolution of two Lorentzian distribution functions results in a Lorentzian distribution function in which the total width is the sum of the widths of the particle size distribution function \( \beta_{D} \) and the microstrain distribution function \( \beta_{\epsilon} \).</p>

                            To determine the crystallite dimensions and microstrain in materials using X-ray diffraction, it is necessary to obtain the values of \( \beta_{hkl} \) and \( 2\theta_{hkl} \) for each peak in the sample diffraction pattern. Then, a linear fit is performed with the ordered pairs corresponding to \( 4 \sin{\theta_{hkl}}/\lambda \) and \( \beta_{hkl} \cos{\theta_{hkl}}/\lambda \) for obtaining the angular coefficient, which represents the microdeformation; and also the linear coefficient, which refers to the dimensions of the crystallites. Thus, \( K/ \langle D \rangle \) is the slope and \( \langle \epsilon \rangle \) is the linear coefficient.

Langford,2000) model is an X-ray diffraction analysis technique also used to determine the size of crystallites and microstrain in crystalline materials.

                        Starting from the Scherrer and Stokes-Wilson equations and considering that the root mean square (RMS) value of microstrain based on a Gaussian profile is given by \( \langle \epsilon \rangle_{rms} = \epsilon \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \), it is possible to obtain the equation that will be used for fitting as equation (\ref{eq:6}).

                        The calculation of \( \langle D \rangle \) and \( \langle \epsilon \rangle_{rms} \) requires determining the values of \( \beta_{hkl} \) and \( 2\theta_{hkl} \) for each peak in the diffraction pattern from the sample. Thus, it is possible to determine the ordered pairs for each peak, where \( x \) represents \( d_{hkl}^2 \) and \( y \) is given by \( \frac{d_{hkl} ^2\beta_{hkl}^2 \cos^2\theta_{hkl}}{\lambda^2} \). After fitting, one can employ the slope and linear coefficient values to determine \( \langle D \rangle \) and \( \langle \epsilon \rangle_{rms} \). It is also noteworthy that \( (K/ \langle D \rangle)^{2} \) is the slope and \( 2 \pi \langle \epsilon \rangle_{rms}^2 \) is the linear coefficient.

                    <p>According to Halder and Wagner (Halder & C. Wagner, 1966), it is not appropriate to assume that the profile of a diffraction peak is exclusively described by the Lorentz function, as stated by the Williamson-Hall technique or exclusively described by the Gaussian function according to the Size-Strain method. This limitation occurs because the Gaussian function does not fit adequately to the tail regions, while the Lorentz function fits well to the tails but not to the peak. To overcome these problems, a symmetric Voigt profile is proposed, which consists of a convolution of the Lorentz function with the Gaussian function. Therefore, the total width is given by equation (\ref{eq:7}), where the width due to the size of the crystallite \( \beta_{D} \) represents the Lorentzian component and the width due to the microstrain \( \beta_\epsilon \) corresponds to the Gaussian component.</p>

                <p>The response of a material to the application of a stress is strongly influenced by its crystallographic orientation, denoted by \([hkl]\). In solid bodies, the deformation resulting from an applied stress is generally recoverable within the elastic limit; that is, the material returns to its original state as soon as the stress is removed. Under low stress conditions, Hooke's Law is applicable, where the deformation is directly proportional to the intensity of the applied stress. This fundamental relationship distinguishes two types of material behavior: isotropic, where mechanical properties are uniform in all directions, and anisotropic, where mechanical properties vary depending on the crystallographic direction. This distinction is fundamental to understanding how different materials respond to different stresses and potentially improving their applications in science and technology. One way to express the relationship between deformations and stresses in crystalline materials is through second order tensors. Consider an isotropic crystal structure subjected to tensile stress \(\sigma\). The longitudinal deformation \(e\) is equal to \(\Delta l / l\), where \(\Delta l\) is the increase in length and \(l\) is the original length. According to Hooke's Law, the relationship between surface tension \(\sigma\) and microstrain \(\epsilon\) is described by the equations (\ref{eq:11}) or (\ref{eq:12}) , where \(E\) represents the Young's modulus of the material and \(S=1/E\) (SNOKE, 2020; HAUSSÜHL, 2007; NYE, 2006).</p>

                <p>
                    \begin{equation} \tag{11}
                    \sigma = E_{hkl} \varepsilon \label{eq:11}
                    \end{equation}
                </p>

                <p>
                    \begin{equation} \tag{12}
                    \varepsilon = S \sigma \label{eq:12}
                    \end{equation}
                </p>




                The constant \(S\) is called the elastic compliance constant, or simply compliance, for this specific arrangement of stress and strain directions. Alternatively, we could write

                \[
                \sigma = C \varepsilon \quad \text{and} \quad C = \frac{1}{S}, \tag{13, 14}
                \]
                where \(C\) is the elastic stiffness constant or stiffness. In general, a homogeneous stress and a homogeneous strain are usually specified by second-order tensors. If a homogeneous stress \(\sigma_{ij}\) is applied to a crystal, the resulting strain \(\varepsilon_{ij}\) is such that each component is linearly related to all components of the stress. Specifically, the 81 compliances \(s_{ijkl}\) that characterize the elastic properties of a crystal are components of a fourth-order tensor if they obey the law of tensor transformation during the change of coordinate axes, given by:
                \begin{equation}
                       T'_{ijkl} = a_{im} a_{jn} a_{ko} a_{lp} T_{mnop}.
                \end{equation}

                In the theory of elasticity, the elastic potential energy, denoted as \(\Psi\), is a function of the deformation components \(\epsilon_i\) of a body. These components are associated with the stresses \(\sigma_{ij}\) through the elasticity constants \(c_{ij}\), which characterize the material's response to the imposed deformations. The relationship between stresses and strains in this context is formalized by the derivative of the elastic potential energy with respect to the strain components:

                \begin{equation} \label{eq:energia_potencial} \tag{15}
                \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \epsilon_i} = c_{ij} \epsilon_j,
                \end{equation}


                where \(c_{ij}\) represents the elasticity constants of the material. This equation illustrates a specific case of Hooke's law for elastic materials, connecting stress, strain, and the material's elastic properties (NYE, 2006).

                To explore the symmetric properties of elasticity constants, we differentiate both sides of the above equation with respect to another strain component \(\epsilon_j\):
                \[
                \frac{\partial}{\partial \epsilon_j} \left( \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \epsilon_i} \right) = c_{ij}. \tag{16}
                \]
                Given that the potential energy function \(\Psi\) depends only on the current state of deformation of the body, and not on the sequence of how these deformations were applied, we conclude that the order of differentiation is irrelevant. Therefore, the stiffness matrix \(c_{ij}\) is symmetric:
                \[
                c_{ij} = c_{ji}. \tag{17}
                \]

                Furthermore, there is a direct relationship between the elasticity constants \(c_{ij}\) and the compliances \(s_{ij}\), which are coefficients that describe the deformation of the material under applied stress:
                \[
                s_{ij} = s_{ji}. \tag{18} \label{eq:18}
                \]

                This symmetry in the stiffness and compliance tensors is a fundamental property of elastic materials, indicating that stress responses are independent of the order of applied loads. The symmetry of the matrices \((c_{ij})\) and \((s_{ij})\), indicated by relations (\ref{eq:19}) and (\ref{eq:20}), reduces the number of independent stiffness and compliance constants from 36 to 21, which significantly simplifies the analysis of elasticity problems. By integrating equation (\ref{eq:18}) and utilizing the symmetry property (\ref{eq:19}), it is determined that the work required to produce a deformation \(\epsilon_i\) in a unit volume of the crystal, known as strain energy, is given by:

                \[
                \frac{1}{2}c_{ij} \epsilon_i \epsilon_j \tag{19} \label{eq:19}
                \]
                as referenced in Chapter III, equation (\ref{eq:20}). The presence of symmetry in the crystal implies a reduction in the number of independent constants \(s_{ij} \) and \(c_{ij} \). Elasticity is a property that remains unchanged under the operation of a center of symmetry, which means that if the reference axes are transformed by such an operation, the components of the stiffness and compliance tensors do not change. The proof is direct: the elements \(a_{ij} \) of the transformation matrix correspond to \(-\delta_{ij} \). Thus, based on equation (\ref{eq:11}), we have:

                \[

                <p>highlighting the substitution property of \( \delta_{ij} \) (page 35), and similarly for \( c_{ijkl} \).</p>

                <p>Symmetry elements that are not centers impose additional conditions on the elastic constants. These conditions can be deduced by symmetry arguments similar to those used for piezoelectric modules. For example, in orthorhombic class 222, the compliance \( s_{34} \), which measures the extension in the \( Ox_3 \) direction due to shear around the \( Ox_1 \) direction, becomes zero if we consider the operation of a parallel diad axis to \( Boi_2 \). This shows that the crystal, and consequently the extension along \( Ox_3 \), does not change, implying that \( s_{34} = 0 \). Similar arguments can be applied to other conformities in different classes of crystals.</p>

                <p>The matrices \( E_{hkl} \) and \( S \) are symmetric, which means that the corresponding elements on both sides of the main diagonal are equal (\( a_{ij} = a_{ji} \)), a consequence of the fact that The potential energy of the system is a quadratic function <a href="#ref-nye1985physical">[1]</a>. In many data compendia, such as reference tables, it is more common to find elastic constants \( c_{ij} \) rather than stiffness moduli \( s_{ij} \).</p>

                <p>More generally, the Equation (\ref{eq:11}) can be represented using matrix notation. Applying the conditions described in Equation (\ref{eq:12}), we obtain the equation (\ref{eq:23}). The entries below the main diagonal, specifically in the lower-left half of the matrix, merely confirm that the values above and below the diagonal are identical, illustrating the matrix's symmetry with respect to the main diagonal.</p>

                No surface can completely represent the elastic behavior of a crystal. However, a practical and useful surface is one that illustrates the variation of Young's Modulus with direction. Consider a bar of the crystal cut so that its length is parallel to some arbitrary direction, denoted as \(\sigma_{1}'\). Stress typically induces not only longitudinal and lateral deformations but also shear. Young's Modulus for the stress direction is defined as the ratio of longitudinal stress to longitudinal strain, i.e., \(1/s_{11}'\). Surfaces on which the radius vector in the \(\sigma_{1}'\) direction is proportional to both \(s_{11}\) and \(1/s_{11}'\) are widely used. In practice, surfaces are used where the radius vector in the \(\sigma_{1}'\) direction is proportional to \(s_{11}\) and \(1/s_{11}'\) \cite{nye1985physical}.
                In triclinic systems specifically, the matrix \(S\) is defined by Equation (\ref{eq_S}), and the inverse of Young's modulus is obtained from Equation (\ref{eq:23}), underscoring the inherent symmetry of matrix \(S\). Given the available elastic constants, Young's modulus is calculated using the subsequent expression:

                \begin{equation}
                \begin{aligned}[t]
                \frac{1}{E_{hkl}} = &\alpha_1^4s_{11} + 2\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2s_{12} + 2\alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2s_{13} + 2\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3s_{14} + 2\alpha_1^3\alpha_3s_{15} + 2\alpha_1^3\alpha_2s_{16} \\
                &+ \alpha_2^4s_{22} + 2\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2s_{23} + 2\alpha_2^3\alpha_3s_{24} + 2\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2s_{25} + 2\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3s_{26} + \alpha_3^4s_{33} \\
                &+ 2\alpha_2\alpha_3^3s_{34} + 2\alpha_1\alpha_3^3s_{35} + 2\alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_2s_{36} + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2s_{44} + 2\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2s_{45} + 2\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2s_{46} \\
                &+ \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2s_{55} + 2\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3s_{56} + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2s_{66}.
                \end{aligned}
                \label{eq:23}
                \tag{23}
                \end{equation}

                where \(\alpha_i\) are the directing cosines of a vector that represents the crystallographic direction \([hkl]\) of the reciprocal lattice given by the set of equations corresponding to (\ref{alphas}).

                \begin{align}\label{alphas} \tag{24, 25, 26}
                \alpha_1 &= \frac{h}{\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}} &
                \alpha_2 &= \frac{k}{\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}} &
                \alpha_3 &= \frac{l}{\sqrt {h^2+k^2+l^2}}.
                \end{align}

                The components of matrix \(S\) are referred to as the material's elastic constants. The elastic constants \(s_{ij}\) have been determined for various materials as found in \cite{book:12974}.


                The expressions for the reciprocal of Young's Modulus in the direction of the unit vector \(l_i\) in various crystal systems are collected here.



                Note that in the cubic system, Young's Modulus is not isotropic. The variation with direction depends on \( \frac{1}{2}(l_1^2l_2^2 + l_2^2l_3^2 + l_3^2l_1^2) \). This quantity is zero for the cube axis directions \( <100> \) and reaches its maximum value of \( \frac{1}{3} \) in the directions \( <111> \). Therefore, if \( s_{11} - s_{12} - \frac{1}{2}s_{44} \) is positive (as it is for all cubic metals except molybdenum), Young's Modulus is maximum in the \( <111> \) directions and minimum in the \( <100> \) directions. A surface for which the radius vector is directly proportional to Young's Modulus would then have the shape of a cube with rounded corners and depressions in the center of the faces. Its central sections normal to \( <111> \) are easily seen as circles. \( s_{11} - s_{12} - \frac{1}{2}s_{44} = 0 \) is the condition for elastic isotropy. If \( s_{11} - s_{12} - \frac{1}{2}s_{44} \) is negative, Young's Modulus is minimum for \( <111> \) and maximum for \( <100> \). The Young's Modulus surface then has protrusions along the cube axes.\footnotemark

Its structure can be reverse spinel or mixed spinel. In all isotropic and anisotropic models the procedure is similar, differing only in choosing the model.

                <div id="UDEDM-WHP" class="content">
                    <ul>
                        <p>For anisotropic models, the material's elastic stiffness constants \( s_{ij} \) are required. The constants for FM are: \( s_{11} = 6.8 (TPa)^{-1} \), \( s_{12} = -2.2 (TPa)^{-1} \), and \( s_{44} = 12.2 (TPa)^{-1} \). In anisotropic models, the user must also load the “instrumental” file by clicking on the “import” button in the menu bar and then selecting the instrumental file as mentioned in the previous example. The user should click on the "Anisotropic Model" tab and select the desired model (UDEDM - WHP), and finally load the .csv file containing the FWHM and the angular positions of each diffraction peak, as shown in the following figure. </p>

                        <p style="text-align: center;">
                            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img10.png')}}" style="width: 600px; height: 350px;">
                        </p>

                        <p> Then click on "Insert Const" to insert the values of each elastic stiffness constant. A screen similar to the one below should appear. </p>

                        <p style="text-align: center;">

                        </p>

                        <p> Right after inserting the stiffness constants and clicking on "Fit Model", an adjustment for the anisotropic model WHP-UDEDM is shown in Figure ref{}. The values of size and microstrain can be seen at the top, as well as the adjustment of the WHP model. The MSS also allows the user to export all the adjusted and calculated data by the program, it is enough to click on the “Export Data” button located on the menu bar and select which files should be exported. </p>
